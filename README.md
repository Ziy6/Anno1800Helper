# Anno1800Helper
An android application that calculates population and building resource requirements in the game, Anno 1800.

This is a personal project that was not meant for distribution and has no links to direct installation.

To get/test the application, load the code to the android studio IDE and either use the phone emulator or enable USB debugging 
in the developer options section on an android phone and run the application on that phone.

Once the application is loaded onto the phone and run for the first time, the database version number in the 'Database' class should be changed to a number greater than 0 so the database won't reinsert values to the internal database.

Note:The application was designed to work on a screen with a 37:18 ratio (Samsung Galaxy S8), the application might not work with a different screen ratio.
